# Battle System Restoration - Complete Attack Animation System

## üîß What Was Fixed

After pulling changes from remote that reverted the proper attack animation system, the following fixes were applied to restore the complete animation system:

---

## ‚úÖ Files Updated

### 1. **PlayerBattleController.cs**

#### Issues Found:

- ‚ùå Duplicate attack execution code (attack was being executed twice)
- ‚ùå Missing `ExecuteCounterAttackOnEnemy()` method for parry counter-attacks
- ‚ùå Haptic feedback code misplaced

#### Fixes Applied:

‚úÖ **Removed duplicate attack execution**

```csharp
// REMOVED duplicate code:
// ExecuteAttackDamage(target);
// OnActionComplete?.Invoke();
```

‚úÖ **Fixed haptic feedback placement**

- Moved haptic feedback into the completion callback
- Now triggers after attack completes, not during

‚úÖ **Added ExecuteCounterAttackOnEnemy() method**

```csharp
public void ExecuteCounterAttackOnEnemy(BattleCharacter target)
{
    // Plays attack animation
    // Applies 150% damage (1.5x bonus for counter)
    // Includes haptic feedback
}
```

#### Result:

- ‚úÖ Attacks execute exactly once through AnimationSequencer
- ‚úÖ Counter-attacks work properly after successful parry
- ‚úÖ Proper timing and haptic feedback

---

### 2. **BattleManagerV2.cs**

#### Issues Found:

- ‚ùå AnimationSequencer initialization was commented out (`Initialize(null, qteManager)`)
- ‚ùå AnimationSequencer validation was commented out
- ‚ùå AnimationSequencer wasn't being initialized with player's animator
- ‚ùå Deprecated Unity API (`FindObjectsOfType`)

#### Fixes Applied:

‚úÖ **Restored AnimationSequencer initialization**

```csharp
// BEFORE:
playerController.Initialize(null, qteManager);

// AFTER:
playerController.Initialize(playerAnimationSequencer, qteManager);
```

‚úÖ **Added AnimationSequencer animator initialization**

```csharp
if (playerAnimationSequencer != null && playerController?.Character?.Animator != null)
{
    playerAnimationSequencer.Initialize(playerController.Character.Animator, qteManager);
    Debug.Log("AnimationSequencer initialized with player animator");
}
```

‚úÖ **Uncommented AnimationSequencer validation**

```csharp
if (playerAnimationSequencer == null)
    Debug.LogError("AnimationSequencer not assigned!");
```

‚úÖ **Updated deprecated Unity API**

```csharp
// BEFORE:
FindObjectsOfType<EnemyBattleController>();

// AFTER:
FindObjectsByType<EnemyBattleController>(FindObjectsSortMode.None);
```

#### Result:

- ‚úÖ AnimationSequencer properly initialized and validated
- ‚úÖ Player attacks use real animation system
- ‚úÖ QTE windows work correctly
- ‚úÖ No Unity API warnings

---

### 3. **EnemyBattleController.cs**

#### Issues Found:

- ‚ùå Duplicate `HandleParrySuccess()` method
- ‚ùå Broken comment syntax (`}*/` instead of proper comment)
- ‚ùå Ambiguous method calls

#### Fixes Applied:

‚úÖ **Removed duplicate method and fixed comments**

```csharp
// REMOVED commented-out old version with broken syntax
// KEPT clean implementation that delegates to BattleManager
private void HandleParrySuccess()
{
    attackWasParried = true;
    Debug.Log("Enemy attack was parried!");
    // Stamina and counter-attack are handled in BattleManager
}
```

#### Result:

- ‚úÖ No compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Clean code without duplicates
- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns

---

## üéØ System Flow (Fully Restored)

### Player Attack Flow:

```
1. PlayerBattleController.ExecuteLightAttack(target)
   ‚îî‚îÄ> AnimationSequencer.PlayAnimationSequence(attackData, onComplete, onHit)
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Plays animation in Animator
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Tracks normalized time
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Opens QTE windows at specified times
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Calls onHit callback at damage frame
           ‚îî‚îÄ> ExecuteAttackDamage(target)
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Calls onComplete callback when animation ends
           ‚îî‚îÄ> OnActionComplete event
           ‚îî‚îÄ> Haptic feedback
```

### Parry & Counter-Attack Flow:

```
1. Enemy attacks
   ‚îî‚îÄ> ParrySystem.OpenParryWindow()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Player presses parry button
           ‚îî‚îÄ> ParrySystem.OnParrySuccess event
               ‚îî‚îÄ> BattleManager.HandleParrySuccess()
                   ‚îî‚îÄ> DestroyParryIndicator()
                   ‚îî‚îÄ> ExecuteCounterAttack() coroutine
                       ‚îî‚îÄ> PlayerController.PlayParryAnimation()
                       ‚îî‚îÄ> PlayerController.ExecuteCounterAttackOnEnemy(enemy)
                           ‚îî‚îÄ> Plays attack animation
                           ‚îî‚îÄ> Deals 150% damage
                           ‚îî‚îÄ> Haptic feedback
                       ‚îî‚îÄ> Restore player stamina
                       ‚îî‚îÄ> Update UI
```

## üìä Expected Console Output

### Battle Start:

```
=== BATTLE START ===
AnimationSequencer initialized with player animator
PlayerBattleController initialized
=== PLAYER TURN ===
```

### Player Attack:

```
Playing attack animation through AnimationSequencer
QTE Window Started! Press QTE Button
[Player presses button]
QTE Success! (or PERFECT QTE!)
Player deals 20 damage to Enemy
Player action complete
```

### Enemy Attack with Parry:

```
=== ENEMY TURN ===
Enemy is thinking...
Enemy attacks!
Playing enemy attack animation: EnemyAttack
PARRY WINDOW! Press Parry Button
Parry window opened! Creating indicator
[Player presses button]
Perfect Parry! (or Successful Parry!)
Parry successful! Executing counter-attack!
Counter-attack hitting enemy!
Counter-attack deals 30 damage to Enemy!
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "No AnimationSequencer or attack data - executing attack immediately"

- **Cause:** AnimationSequencer not assigned in BattleManager
- **Fix:** Assign AnimationSequencer GameObject in Inspector

### "AnimationSequencer is null - attacks will execute without animation tracking"

- **Cause:** Initialize() called with null
- **Fix:** Already fixed in BattleManagerV2.cs (line 107)

### "Cannot execute counter-attack - light attack data is null!"

- **Cause:** AttackAnimationData not assigned to PlayerBattleController
- **Fix:** Create and assign AttackAnimationData ScriptableObject

### Attack executes twice

- **Cause:** Old code had duplicate execution
- **Fix:** Already fixed in PlayerBattleController.cs (removed duplicate)

### QTE doesn't respond to input

- **Cause:** Input Actions not created or not assigned
- **Fix:** Follow INPUT_SYSTEM_SETUP.md guide
