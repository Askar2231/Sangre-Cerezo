## Step-by-Step: From Scene Setup to Working Battle with Animations & UI

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, you **MUST** setup the Input System:
- **üìñ See:** `INPUT_SYSTEM_SETUP.md` for creating Input Actions
- This guide assumes you have already created:
  - `CombatInputActions` Input Actions asset
  - `QTE` and `Parry` actions configured

If you haven't done this yet, **STOP** and complete `INPUT_SYSTEM_SETUP.md` first!

## 1. Scene Setup

### **Step 1.1: Create Battle Scene**

1. Create a new scene: `File ‚Üí New Scene`
2. Save it as: `BattleScene`

### **Step 1.2: Create GameObjects Hierarchy**

Create this hierarchy in your scene:

```
BattleScene
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BattleManager (empty GameObject)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player (your player character)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Enemy (your enemy character)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BattleSystems (empty GameObject - parent for organization)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AnimationSequencer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QTEManager
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ParrySystem
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BattleCamera (your camera)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BattleUI (Canvas)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HealthDisplay (Panel)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ActionButtons (Panel)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TurnDisplay (Panel)
```

**To create each:**

## 5. Create Attack Data

### **Step 5.1: Create AttackAnimationData ScriptableObject**

1. In Project window, navigate to: `Assets/Data/Battle/` (create folders if needed)
2. Right-click ‚Üí **Create ‚Üí Battle ‚Üí Attack Animation Data**
3. Name it: **"LightAttack_Data"**

### **Step 5.2: Configure Attack Data**

Select **LightAttack_Data** and configure:

```
ANIMATION:
‚Ä¢ Animation State Name: "LightAttack"

**How to calculate values:**
- **Animation Duration:** The length of your animation in seconds
- **QTE Timings:** When to show QTE prompts (0.0 = start, 1.0 = end)
- **Hit Normalized Time:** When weapon connects (e.g., if hit is at 1.125s in a 1.5s animation: 1.125/1.5 = 0.75)

### **Step 5.3: Create SkillData (Optional)**

## 9. Test

### **Step 9.1: Start Battle Manually**

Since `BattleManagerV2` doesn't auto-start, you need a trigger. Options:

**Option A: Create Battle Starter**

1. Create script: **`BattleStarter.cs`**
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class BattleStarter : MonoBehaviour
{
    public BattleManagerV2 battleManager;

    void Start()
    {
        if (battleManager != null)
        {
            // Start battle after 1 second
            Invoke("StartBattle", 1f);
        }
    }

    void StartBattle()
    {
        battleManager.StartBattle();
    }
}
```

2. Add to an empty GameObject in scene
3. Assign BattleManager reference

**Option B: Use Trigger Zone**

Use your existing `BattleStarter.cs` with trigger collider.

### **Step 9.2: Enter Play Mode**

Press **Play** and check:

**Initial State:**
- [ ] Battle starts automatically or on trigger
- [ ] Console shows: "=== BATTLE START ==="
- [ ] Console shows: "=== PLAYER TURN ==="
- [ ] UI shows player/enemy health
- [ ] UI shows "PLAYER TURN"
- [ ] Action buttons appear

### **Step 9.3: Test Player Attack**

Click **Attack Button** and check:
- [ ] Player attack animation plays
- [ ] Console: "Playing attack animation through AnimationSequencer"
- [ ] QTE windows appear during animation
- [ ] Damage applies to enemy at correct time
- [ ] Enemy health decreases
- [ ] Console: "Player deals X damage to Enemy"

### **Step 9.4: Test Enemy Turn**

Click **End Turn** button and check:
- [ ] UI shows "ENEMY TURN"
- [ ] Enemy attack animation plays
- [ ] Console: "Playing enemy attack animation: EnemyAttack"
- [ ] Parry indicator appears (if prefab assigned)
- [ ] Console: "Parry window opened!"
- [ ] If you press Space: "Parry successful!"
- [ ] If you miss: Damage applies to player

### **Step 9.5: Test Parry**

During enemy turn, when parry window opens:
- Press **Space** key
- [ ] Player parry animation plays
- [ ] Enemy stagger animation plays
- [ ] Console: "Playing player parry animation: Parry"
- [ ] Console: "Parry successful!"
- [ ] Player takes no damage
- [ ] Player gains stamina

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **"AnimationSequencer is null" Warning**
‚úÖ **Fix:** Assign AnimationSequencer GameObject in BattleManager Inspector

### **"No AnimationSequencer or attack data"**
‚úÖ **Fix:** 
1. Assign AttackAnimationData to PlayerBattleController
2. Make sure AnimationSequencer is assigned in BattleManager

### **Animations don't play**
‚úÖ **Check:**
1. Animation state names match exactly (case-sensitive!)
2. Animation clips assigned to states
3. Animator component assigned to BattleCharacter
4. Transitions have "Has Exit Time" enabled

### **QTE windows don't appear**
‚úÖ **Check:**
1. QTEManager is assigned in BattleManager
2. AttackAnimationData has values in `qteNormalizedTimings` array
3. Console for: "QTE Window triggered!"

### **Buttons don't work**
‚úÖ **Check:**
1. Button OnClick events are set up
2. BattleManager GameObject is assigned to button events
3. Correct functions are selected in dropdown
4. Canvas has EventSystem (auto-created with Canvas)

### **Health/Stamina UI doesn't update**
‚úÖ **Check:**
1. Text components are assigned in BattleManager Inspector
2. Check Console for any null reference errors

### **Battle doesn't start**
‚úÖ **Check:**
1. Call `battleManager.StartBattle()` from code or trigger
2. Player and Enemy controllers are assigned
3. Enemy GameObject is active in scene
