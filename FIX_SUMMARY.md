## 🔧 Quick Fix Summary

### **3 Files Fixed:**

   - ✅ Fixed: Single execution through AnimationSequencer
   - ✅ Added: ExecuteCounterAttackOnEnemy() method

2. **BattleManagerV2.cs**

   - ❌ AnimationSequencer initialization was null
   - ❌ Not initializing animator
   - ✅ Fixed: Properly initializes AnimationSequencer
